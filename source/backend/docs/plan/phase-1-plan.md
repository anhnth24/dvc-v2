# Phase 1: Core Foundation Implementation Plan

**Phase:** 1
**Status:** Ready
**Created Date:** 2025-09-21
**Dependencies:** None (Initial Phase)
**Duration:** 8 weeks
**Priority:** Critical

---

## 1. Phase Overview

### 1.1 Objectives
This phase establishes the foundational infrastructure and core services for the DVC v2 Backend system. The focus is on creating a solid, production-ready foundation that can handle 21,000 concurrent civil servants and 270 documents/second throughput.

### 1.2 Scope
- **Shared Libraries Foundation**: Core entities, contracts, infrastructure components
- **Database Foundation**: Entity Framework setup, migrations, repositories
- **API Gateway Infrastructure**: YARP configuration, routing, authentication
- **Core Service APIs**: User Service, Document Service basic operations
- **Message Queue Infrastructure**: RabbitMQ setup with simplified single-exchange architecture
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT, OAuth2, basic RBAC implementation
- **Basic Monitoring**: Health checks, logging, telemetry setup

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- All core services can start and respond to health checks
- Basic CRUD operations work for Users and Documents
- JWT authentication flow is functional
- Message queue publishes and consumes messages successfully
- API Gateway routes requests correctly to services
- Database migrations run successfully
- Integration tests pass for core workflows

---

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Simplified Architecture Approach
Following the PRD's "smart simplification" philosophy:
- **Single Database**: Use materialized views instead of full CQRS
- **Single Message Exchange**: Unified "dvc.events" exchange with routing keys
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven design without over-engineering
- **Essential Patterns Only**: Repository, Unit of Work, Event-driven, Circuit Breaker

### 2.2 Core Components

#### 2.2.1 Shared Libraries Structure
```
src/Shared/
├── DVC.Shared.Core/              # Domain entities, exceptions, constants
├── DVC.Shared.Contracts/         # Events, commands, queries, DTOs
└── DVC.Shared.Infrastructure/    # Cross-cutting concerns, repositories, messaging
```

#### 2.2.2 Service Structure
```
src/Services/
├── UserService/                  # Authentication, RBAC, user management
├── DocumentService/              # Document CRUD, file handling
├── NotificationService/          # Real-time notifications via SignalR
└── WorkflowService/              # Basic workflow engine (Phase 2)
```

#### 2.2.3 Infrastructure Components
```
src/Infrastructure/
├── ApiGateway/                   # YARP configuration
├── Database/                     # Migrations, seed data
└── MessageQueue/                 # RabbitMQ setup
```

## 3. Implementation Priority

### 3.1 Week 1-2: Foundation Setup
1. **Shared Libraries** (Priority: Critical)
   - Core entities and value objects
   - Common exceptions and result patterns
   - Infrastructure abstractions

2. **Database Infrastructure** (Priority: Critical)
   - Entity Framework context setup
   - Initial entity configurations
   - Migration infrastructure

### 3.2 Week 3-4: Core Services
1. **User Service MVP** (Priority: Critical)
   - User entity and repository
   - Basic authentication endpoints
   - JWT token generation

2. **Document Service MVP** (Priority: Critical)
   - Document entity and repository
   - File upload/download endpoints
   - Basic CRUD operations

### 3.3 Week 5-6: Integration Layer
1. **API Gateway Setup** (Priority: High)
   - YARP configuration
   - Service routing
   - Authentication middleware

2. **Message Queue Infrastructure** (Priority: High)
   - RabbitMQ setup with single exchange
   - Basic publisher/consumer implementation
   - Event handling infrastructure

### 3.4 Week 7-8: Testing & Hardening
1. **Integration Testing** (Priority: High)
   - End-to-end API tests
   - Database integration tests
   - Message queue tests

2. **Monitoring & Observability** (Priority: Medium)
   - Health checks implementation
   - Structured logging with Serilog
   - Basic telemetry setup

## 4. Key Deliverables

### 4.1 Core Services
- **User Service API**: Authentication, user management, basic RBAC
- **Document Service API**: Document CRUD, file operations
- **Notification Service API**: Real-time notifications via SignalR
- **API Gateway**: Request routing, authentication, rate limiting

### 4.2 Infrastructure Components
- **Shared Libraries**: Core, Contracts, Infrastructure packages
- **Database**: Entity Framework context, migrations, repositories
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ publisher/consumer infrastructure
- **Configuration**: Docker compose setup for local development

### 4.3 Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests**: Repository and service layer tests
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint tests
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Deployment Scripts**: Docker configurations

## 5. Risk Assessment

### 5.1 High Risk Items
1. **Database Performance**: Materialized views implementation complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple views, optimize iteratively

2. **Message Queue Configuration**: Single exchange routing complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of routing key patterns

3. **Authentication Integration**: JWT and RBAC complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven libraries, implement incrementally

### 5.2 Medium Risk Items
1. **Service Discovery**: Manual configuration vs automatic discovery
   - **Mitigation**: Start with configuration-based routing

2. **Database Migration Strategy**: Large schema changes
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental migrations, rollback procedures
